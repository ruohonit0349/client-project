                <p>Chippewa Falls resident Alexis Johnson picked up a copy of <i>The French Teacher's Husband</i> 
                    and simply could not put it down. "I was hooked from the very beginning," she said. 
                    "The characters, the plot, the sheer suspense...it was the best book I read all year. 
                    The author is obviously a very gifted individual who knows how to capture human thoughts 
                    and emotions like no other. I recommend this book to absolutely everyone." Alexis has 
                    been a loyal Books 4 Less visitor since 2014.</p>
                <p><i>No, Running is Actually Super Fun</i> is a guidebook to all things running, and Johnny 
                    Lund from North Eau Claire had a fanstastic time reading it. Johnny grabbed the short 
                    book from a shelf at our store and it inspired him to run an ultra marathon in Nevada 
                    next spring. "I kind of got out of running after high school, and I needed some 
                    motivation to start again. This book gave me the boost I needed and provided so many 
                    helpful tips for runners of all distances and abilities. Thank you to employee Jane for 
                    recommending it to me." Thank you, Johnny, for being an awesome customer since 2021. 
                    Note: If anyone reading this would like to travel to Reno to watch a running race next 
                    April, Johnny would appreciate the support.</p>
                 <p><i>Last June on the Danube</i> is a popular work of historical fiction and is the new favorite 
                    book of Randall Park resident Jordan Hollingsworth. "What a find. What a page-turner. 
                    What an extraordinary book," she said. Jordan picked up <i>Last June on the Danube</i> three 
                    months ago and finally got around to reading it last week. "I can't believe I waited 
                    so long to read this. The author does such a great job of putting you at the scene. I 
                    truly felt like I was in 1930s Budapest myself." Jordan has been a happy customer of 
                    Books 4 Less since 2017.</p>

                <p>Kyle Reynolds from the Eastside Hill has already read <i>Cold Nights in Walford Heights</i> three 
                    times. He took a chance on a copy while visiting our store last month and it definitely 
                    paid off. "I was never really a fan of romantic novels. They just weren't my thing," he 
                    explained. "I honestly just picked up <i>Cold Nights in Walford Heights</i> because the cover 
                    looked cool. I ended up enjoying the story so much, I read it two more times. I still 
                    can't believe what Jason did. And when Alex found out? Devastating. It's no wonder he..." 
                    (Kyle went on to spoil the entire novel. Thanks Kyle.) But also thank you Kyle for 
                    being a Books 4 Less patron for three years! We appreciate you.</p>
