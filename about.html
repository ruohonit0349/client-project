                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Books 4 Less was founded in 1996 by Eau Claire natives Rachel Young and Jamie McKay. 
                    They leased a vacant storefront in downtown Eau Claire and began selling like-new 
                    books and magazines. Their business quickly became popular with University students 
                    and young professionals who enjoyed the shop's calming atmosphere and affordable 
                    prices.</p>
                <p>Many young customers would tell Young and McKay that they enjoyed reading but often 
                    couldn't find the time to read longer novels due to their hectic lifestyles. The 
                    owners began organizing the books by length and the amount of time they estimated 
                    it would take an average person to read them. Patrons of the store appreciated the 
                    new setup and their new ability to browse titles by time commitment.</p>
                <p>Business continued to grow and the small shopfront began to feel too small for the 
                    amount of customers the store was receiving. Young and McKay decided to lease their 
                    current location in the spring of 2007 and were operating at full force again by 
                    that fall. Local bus routes allowed the store to continue serving its loyal 
                    customers while the new location next to the highway and the mall brought the store 
                    a whole new shopper base as well.

                <p>Books 4 Less continues to serve the Eau Claire area and beyond with the same 
                    friendly service and strong dedication for which they've always been known. The 
                    business is ready to expand again and is hoping to open up a new location in the 
                    twin cities within the next two years. Now in their late 60s, Young and McKay still 
                    show up to work every day eager to serve their community with all the good books 
                    they could ever need.</p>
